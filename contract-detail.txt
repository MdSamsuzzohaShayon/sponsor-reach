We're looking for a skilled developer or data automation expert to help us with a two-stage project focused on extracting and enriching data from the UK government's sponsorship licence register and integrating it with our Salesforce CRM.

Stage 1: Data Extraction, Enrichment & Outreach Automation
Objective:
We want to track and act on changes to the official UK Government Worker and Temporary Worker Sponsor Licence register.

Core Data Source:
The official data is published and updated here:
ðŸ”— UK Gov CSV â€“ Sponsor Licences

This website provides a cleaner visual of the updates, which reflects the data we want to work with (but we donâ€™t want to rely on this site for automation):
ðŸ”— Reference Only: licensed-sponsors-uk.com

Tasks:

Set up a system to daily monitor changes/updates in the UK Gov CSV file (new companies added, changes, or removed).

Identify newly added sponsors.

Automate data enrichment for each sponsor company, including:

Company Owner Name

HR Director Name

Company Email(s)

Contact Number(s)

Industry Type

Website URL

Automatically send personalized outreach emails to relevant contacts (owner, HR, etc.) offering our services.

Stage 2: CRM Integration with Salesforce
Objective:
Keep our Salesforce CRM in sync with the latest sponsor data.

Tasks:

Automatically add new sponsor companies with enriched details to Salesforce.

Update records with any changes (e.g., contact details or licence status).

Remove or archive companies no longer listed on the sponsor register.

Ongoing Maintenance & Support
We want this system to run reliably long-term.
Please also include:

A monthly or quarterly maintenance cost to ensure the solution continues to work as expected

Support for handling potential data structure changes from the UK Government site

Monitoring, logging, and error alerts

Proposal Requirements:
Please include the following in your proposal:

A breakdown of your approach for both Stage 1 and Stage 2

Tools/languages/frameworks you plan to use

Estimated timeline for each stage

Your total price, with a breakdown by stage

Your proposed ongoing maintenance cost

Any relevant experience or examples of similar projects

This is a key automation project for our team and could lead to ongoing work if successful.
Looking forward to reviewing your proposal!
